# shell_scripting_lab

to beggin you should have all necessary files
- config.env
- functions.sh
- reminder.sh
- submissions.txt
run the script create_environment in the root directory of the repo

## Note:
- all scripts can run from the root of the repo the script
- create_environment has enough error handling and files availability checks for all of the necessary tasks (the ones i saw atleast)
- to retry the experiment just remove the directory submission_reminder_app and copy everything from .cache directory into the root of the repo, then you can run create_environment again to see the magic happen
- rm -r submission_reminder_app && cp .cache/* .
